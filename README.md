`vsleep` is a small program to provide a progress indicator and sleep.
I like it for long-running sleeps.
Usage: vsleep <time>, where time is in seconds, accurate to one decimal
point.

`vsleep 3.8`: sleep for 3.8 seconds
`vsleep 2` or `vsleep 2.0`: sleep for 2 seconds

Minimum sleep interval is 100ms.
